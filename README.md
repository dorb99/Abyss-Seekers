In a team of 4, we embarked on a 7-day final project. We collectively decided to prioritize self-learning, a skill we deemed the most important from our bootcamp experience. With this decision made, we set out on a challenging task: learning C# and Unity in just one week to develop a game.

The journey was intense, with long hours into the night. In fact, we found ourselves unexpectedly spending two consecutive nights in the office just before the presentation. Despite the challenges, we persevered and learned a lot along the way, not only about C# and Unity but also about effective teamwork and collaboration.

My role primarily focused on the backend aspects of the project. I handled SQL data storage, backend functions, and class development. Additionally, I pitched in to assist my teammates in various other areas as needed.

Overall, it was a demanding yet rewarding experience that pushed us to our limits and taught us valuable lessons in self-learning and teamwork
